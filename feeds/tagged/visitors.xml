As usual, this week's meeting is going to be this Friday from 4â€“6 in GOL/70-2520, the small database lab on the second floor of GCCIS. If you can only attend part of the meeting, don't be afraid to show up halfway through!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week, we're going to have a special guest appearance from former RITlug president and vice president, Michael Zeller and Dave Eddy. They'll be giving a presentation on Lx Branding Zones, a virtualisation technology that I won't attempt to explain here. If you want to find out more, come to the meeting! The second half of the meeting is still planned for open discussion, although the presentation may be longer than an hour this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope to see you at this week's meeting!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="visitors"></category><category term="virtualisation"></category></entry></feed>
