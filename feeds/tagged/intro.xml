As usual, this week's meeting is going to be this Friday from 4–6 in GOL/70-2520, the small database lab on the second floor of GCCIS. If you can only attend part of the meeting, don't be afraid to show up halfway through!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week, we're going to spend the first hour working together on an "introduction to Linux" presentation that we'll show at the beginning of the spring semester. We're going to be figuring out what we know about Linux and just how much we need to say to a new Linux user so that they know what to expect. The second half of the meeting will be reserved for open discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope to see you at this week's meeting!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="intro"></category></entry><entry><title>Week 1 Meeting</title><link href="https://ritlug.github.io/posts/2014/Aug/fall-2014-week-1.htm" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-08-28T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Claire Charron</name></author><id>tag:ritlug.github.io,2014-08-28:posts/2014/Aug/fall-2014-week-1.htm</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hello, everyone!

&lt;p&gt;This week, we're going to be getting to know each other, and our members who use Linux regularly are going to have a chance to show off some of the cool things that they've done with Linux on their laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also a good time for those who haven't installed Linux to take a peek at what using a free OS on a day-to-day basis is like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because this is the first meeting, we'll be spending the entire time getting to know each other, showing off our Linux setups, and talking more about what the club is about. Next week's meeting will have a one-hour presentation followed by discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope to see you at this week's meeting!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="intro"></category><category term="open meeting"></category></entry></feed>
