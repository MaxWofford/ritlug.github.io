Our first meeting of the semester is this Friday from 4–6 in GOL/70-2520, the small database lab on the second floor. If you can only attend part of the meeting, don't be afraid to show up halfway through!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off, we're trying something new this spring: all of the semester's events will be kept on a public schedule, which you can find &lt;a href="/schedule.htm"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. If you're interested in doing a presentation this semester, check out what weeks are free and talk to one of the members of Eboard!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first week, we're having an open meeting where people can show up, meet people, hang out, and ask questions about installing Linux. If you aren't sure where to start, bring your laptop and we'll help you install Linux before the meeting ends. Be sure to tell your friends; everyone's invited!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope to see you at this week's meeting!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="open meeting"></category></entry><entry><title>Week 13 Meeting</title><link href="https://ritlug.github.io/posts/2014/Nov/fall-2014-week-13.htm" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-11-21T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Claire Charron</name></author><id>tag:ritlug.github.io,2014-11-21:posts/2014/Nov/fall-2014-week-13.htm</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hello, everyone!

&lt;p&gt;Like the previous weeks, we don't have a major topic set for this meeting. Next week, we're not having a meeting because of thanksgiving, and the next week, plan to show up to the room on time because we're going to meet up and drive somewhere to have food and congratulate our graduating members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continuing off of the stuff from last week, we're going to spend this week's meeting talking about the topics of the weeks for next semester, what's in store for the club, and a potential end-of-semester celebration for our members that are done with classes after this fall. As usual, the second hour of the meeting will be reserved for open discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of us went to the career fair this week, so, we're going to spend this week's meeting relaxing and talking about our experience with using Linux in industry. We'll take the time to share what kinds of things are good to know for your next co-op, or what some people have done in the past. There will be no presentation this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week, we're going to be getting to know each other, and our members who use Linux regularly are going to have a chance to show off some of the cool things that they've done with Linux on their laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also a good time for those who haven't installed Linux to take a peek at what using a free OS on a day-to-day basis is like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because this is the first meeting, we'll be spending the entire time getting to know each other, showing off our Linux setups, and talking more about what the club is about. Next week's meeting will have a one-hour presentation followed by discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
