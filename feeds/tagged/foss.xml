As usual, this week's meeting is going to be this Friday from 4â€“6 in GOL/70-2520, the small database lab on the second floor of GCCIS. If you can only attend part of the meeting, don't be afraid to show up halfway through!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week, we're going to spend approximately the first hour talking about &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_%28software%29"&gt;git&lt;/a&gt; and open-source licensing. We're going to be talking about some of the cool things that you can do about git that maybe some of us don't know, and what you should do to license our open-source projects. The second hour of the meeting will be reserved for open discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope to see you at this week's meeting!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="git"></category><category term="foss"></category></entry></feed>
