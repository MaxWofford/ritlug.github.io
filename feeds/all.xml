&lt;p&gt;Imagine RIT is just around the corner on May 2nd! We're going to set up an exhibit this year as we always do, and we're going to be showing off another tableful of computers which all run Linux. This week, we're going to spend the time to talk more about some of the things that we want to show off at this year's exhibit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're a current student who's either active with RITlug or wants to be, let us know before April 1st and you can officially help out with the event, which gets you a free T-shirt and either Dinosaur BBQ or 7$ of food debit for lunch. If you don't tell us before the 1st of April, or if you're not a current student, you can still help out, but you won't get any of the cool free stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope to see you at this week's meeting!

&lt;p&gt;This week's meeting will be a presentation/workshop on Gentoo by Gabriel Marcano. He'll be giving us a tour of what it's like to install and work with Gentoo, and how it's not as scary (or as scary) as people think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presentation will be about an hour long, and the remaining hour of the meeting will be left open to socialise. If you're looking to install Linux on your laptop, or install Gentoo, we're here to help!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that you all had fun at the meeting last week! This week's meeting will be our first presentation of the semester, where Mark Repka will discuss some of the cool things about &lt;a href="https://i3wm.org"&gt;i3&lt;/a&gt;, a tiling window manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of us are used to stacking window managers, where windows on a screen are moved around, resized, and stacked with the mouse. Tiling window managers rearrange windows that we open on a grid-like layout, making sure that windows don't overlap. You'd think that the former would be more powerful, but maybe this presentation will change your mind!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presentation will be about an hour long, and the remaining hour of the meeting will be left open to socialise. If you're looking to install Linux on your laptop, or start using i3, we're here to help!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First off, we're trying something new this spring: all of the semester's events will be kept on a public schedule, which you can find &lt;a href="/schedule.htm"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. If you're interested in doing a presentation this semester, check out what weeks are free and talk to one of the members of Eboard!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first week, we're having an open meeting where people can show up, meet people, hang out, and ask questions about installing Linux. If you aren't sure where to start, bring your laptop and we'll help you install Linux before the meeting ends. Be sure to tell your friends; everyone's invited!&lt;/p&gt;

This Friday, to celebrate our members of RITlug who will be done with classes after this semester, we're going to spend the meeting time to go out and get dinner together at a location off-campus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of holding the regular meeting, we're going to meet up in GOL/70-2520 at 4 PM, figure out where we want to go for food, then head out around 4:15–4:30. If you don't have a car, a few members have already offered to provide transportation to and from campus. We'll probably try to be back on campus by 6, but if you have other plans for later, be sure to let us know!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will be our last meeting for the semester, because on next Friday, some of us will be taking finals. For those of us who still have classes next semester, meetings will be at the same time in the same place every week.&lt;/p&gt;
